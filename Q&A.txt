Q:What happens if the designers of the Storage 
class decide to change the implementation of 
the List to LinkedList?

A:There will be a rumtimeException since there 
is no linkedList to be called for. There is only 
an ArrayList and it will not listen to a call 
for a LinkedList. You would need to change more
in the code than just one place for that to function.

Q:Think about the method calls in main - does 
trimToSize() exist in LinkedList?

A:No it doesn't, so main should call for something 
general in List and not specific to Linked- or
ArrayLists.

Q:Should Main know about what concrete type of 
List Storage provides?

A: No there's no reason for main to know what type of 
List is used. Just stick to functions that is general to 
List overall and there should be no problem.
